                    a client–server model. The applications typically

                      PHP, ASP.NET, Python, Node.js, Go or Java in

                    I use popular version control system for developer
                     SVN,Mercurial and the immensely popular Git
                      (not to be confused with GitHub). These tools help 
                      us prevent issues we will certainly all come across 
                      at some point in our web development careers.
                      Whether it’s a change to a single file or countless 
                      changes to your code base, we’ve all been there; the
                       realization that you have just altered or deleted
                        something you shouldn’t have. As the name suggests,
                         the core concept of a Version Control System is the
                          creation of versions of your code over time. 
                          Implicit in this functionality is the ability
                           to revert to an old version of your code and 
                           undo changes that have been made
